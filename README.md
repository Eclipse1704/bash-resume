**Forensica Toolkit**

**Overview**
Forensica is a powerful forensic analysis toolkit designed to help security professionals and system administrators conduct thorough forensic investigations on their systems. With Forensica, you can perform memory forensics, log file analysis, and process anomaly detection, all from the command line. It's a one-stop solution for quick and efficient forensic analysis.

**Features**

*Memory Forensics:* Analyze memory usage and identify processes that exceed specified memory thresholds.

*Log File Analysis:* Search through logs for suspicious patterns, using either default or user-specified log files and patterns.

*Process Anomaly Detection:* Detect suspicious processes based on CPU usage and a baseline of known processes.

**Installation**
*Prerequisities*
Before installing Forensica, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

*Bash:* The script is written in Bash and should run on any Unix-like operating system.
